Butter (Speech-to-text solution for smoothing stuttering)

My team and I made Butter, which placed us third on the OpenAI Whisper Hackathon

Butter is an AI-based integrated chatbot that utilizes specialized speech-to-text conversion to accurately output messages from live voice recordings for individuals that stutter, and answer personal questions regarding stuttering. Butter implements the state-of-the-art Whisper API created by LabLab AI to intuitively translate speech into written form and omit any unintended interruptions in their flow of speech. Our goal is to empower and improve accessibility to communication to users with speech impediments.
