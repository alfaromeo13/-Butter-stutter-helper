# Butter

Speech-to-text solution for smoothing stuttering.


Our team developed Butter, an AI-based integrated chatbot that provides an innovative speech-to-text solution for people who stutter. With this technology, we placed third on the OpenAI Whisper Hackathon. Butter uses advanced speech-to-text conversion to accurately transcribe live voice recordings, enabling individuals who stutter to communicate more effectively. In addition to transcribing messages, Butter can also answer personal questions about stuttering.
Butter's state-of-the-art technology utilizes the Whisper API, created by LabLab AI, to intuitively translate speech into written form and omit any unintended interruptions in the flow of speech. Our goal is to empower people who stutter with improved accessibility to communication.
By delivering accurate and reliable speech-to-text conversion, Butter helps individuals who stutter to communicate more effectively and confidently
